# Team Page Example with Node, Express and Data

A (very) simple Express Generator build with an object that defines a team with roles, description, avatar images etc.

## Installation

You'll need SASS installed on your system for CSS changes (compile to public/css).

Clone, run <code>npm install</code> and then <code>npm start</code>

Don't forget to <code>audit fix!</code>

## Usage

Team partial is loaded via dynamic route; data pulled from the team object in the route file (req.params.member)

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
